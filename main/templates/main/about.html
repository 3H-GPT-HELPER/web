                    Helper is an innovative project that focuses on organizing answers from ChatGPT within our own
                    website, based on user preferences and utilizing an LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model. This
                    approach allows us to provide users with a more tailored and efficient experience. By leveraging
                    ChatGPT&#x27;s conversational abilities and the LDA model&#x27;s topic modeling capabilities, we can
                    categorize and present answers in a structured manner that aligns with the user&#x27;s chosen
                    topics. This integration enhances the overall usability and navigability of our website, ensuring
                    that users can easily access the information they need while engaging in meaningful conversations.
                    With ChatGPT Helper, we strive to provide a unique and optimized chat experience that combines the
                    power of AI-generated responses with intelligent organization through LDA modeling.</div>
